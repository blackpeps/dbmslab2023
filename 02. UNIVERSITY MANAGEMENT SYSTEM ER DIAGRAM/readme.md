## Aim

> Right side

The aim of the University Management System database design is to address the requirements of managing a university. This system is designed to encode students' information, allowing university administrators to access student status and essential information for various transactions. It facilitates the management of student and instructor files, as well as tracking transactions made by enrollees. The objective is to construct an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the university management system and document any assumptions made about the mapping constraints.

## Output

> Right Side

The University Management System consists of several key features, each serving a distinct purpose:

### University Management

This feature encompasses the fundamental details of the university, including the courses and programs offered.

### Student Management

Student Management is a critical component of the system, as it collects essential information about students. This data is used to track their transactions and handle other important matters related to the system.

### Manage Courses and Subjects

University administrators are responsible for selecting courses for each student and assigning appropriate instructors to the subjects covered by these courses.

### Manage Instructors

This feature handles instructors' information, including their complete class schedules and all tasks associated with managing instructors.

### Transaction and Scheduling Management

This feature stores the transactions made by students and instructors, including their information and schedules for various subjects and timetables.

## Result

The ER diagram for the University Management System has been successfully created, providing a visual representation of the system's data structure and relationships.
