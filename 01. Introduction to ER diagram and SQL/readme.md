# Introduction to ER Model

## Points to note while writing the fair record for this experiment

- Thories should be written on the right side. (This will be mentioned at the beginning of the topic.)
- Figures should be on the left side.
- No **AIM, OUTPUT** IN THIS EXPERIMENT.

The **ER model**, also known as **Entity-Relationship model (ERD)**, is a high-level data model used to depict the relationships among entity sets stored in a database. This model defines the data elements and relationships within a specific system, providing a logical structure for databases.

In essence, ER diagrams are a visual tool for explaining the logical structure of databases, built upon three fundamental concepts: entities, attributes, and relationships. Entities are represented by rectangles, attributes by ovals, and relationships by diamond shapes.

## 1. ER Diagrams Symbols & Notations

> Right side

**ER Diagrams Symbols & Notations** primarily consist of three basic symbols:

- **Rectangles**: These represent entity types.
- **Ellipses**: They symbolize attributes.
- **Diamonds**: These denote relationship types.

In addition to these primary symbols, various sub-elements in ERD diagrams serve to enhance their clarity. Lines connect attributes to entity types and entity types to relationship types. Primary key attributes are underlined, and multi-valued attributes are represented by double ellipses.

## 2. Components of an ER Diagram

> Right side

### Entity

Entities are depicted as rectangles, and these rectangles are divided into two parts:

- The **entity name** at the top.
- The **entity attributes** in the lower part.

### Attributes

Attributes are represented by ovals, and a key attribute serves as the unique and distinguishing characteristic of the entity.

### Relationships

To specify the relationships between entities, lines are used to denote relationships in the diagrams. Each relationship is represented by one line and includes information about cardinality and mandatory attributes. Relationships can take on various forms, including one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. The crow's foot symbol indicates the "many" side of a relationship, while the "one" side is represented by a single line.
